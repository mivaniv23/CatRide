## Project Inspiration

The idea for CatRide originated from a discussion with Dr. Lee Ball, Vice President of Sustainability at Catawba College. The goal is to support environmental initiatives by incorporating electric vehicles (EVs), promote student employment opportunities, and enhance campus-wide mobility for students without personal transportation.

## Testing and Debugging

- Manual testing conducted on user authentication and interface workflows  
- Initial limitations from the cloud-hosted Appwrite instance (10 requests/hour) impeded testing  
- Migrated to a locally hosted Appwrite environment to enable unrestricted development  
- Key fixes included session management, request throttling issues, and UI refresh handling
